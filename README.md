## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

The application uses a MySQL database with the following tables:

```sql
-- Users table for authentication and profiles
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255),

## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Database Setup**
   - Create a MySQL database named `together_culture_crm`
   - Run the schema file: `backend/migrations/schema.sql`
   - Optionally run: `backend/migrations/2025_07_28_add_conversations.sql`

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the backend folder
   - Update database credentials and JWT secret

3. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   - The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

4. **Frontend Configuration**
   - The frontend is configured to connect to `http://localhost:5000` by default
   - If your backend runs on a different port, edit `frontend/js/config.js` and change the `API_BASE_URL`
   - Example: Change `API_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:5000'` to your backend URL

5. **Access the Application**
   - You can serve the frontend from any port (using Live Server, Python HTTP server, etc.)
   - Example: `cd frontend && python -m http.server 8080`
   - Open your frontend URL in the browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`)
   - Register as the first admin user or create test accounts

### üåê Development Notes

- **CORS Configuration**: The backend is configured to accept requests from any localhost port for development
- **Flexible Frontend**: The frontend can run on any port and will communicate with the backend properly
- **API Configuration**: All API calls use the centralized config in `frontend/js/config.js`
